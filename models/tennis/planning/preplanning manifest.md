Im trying to create the best possible tennis betting ML model with the largest possible edge to market. I have the hardware to train somewhat larger models (a 7900 XT, a 7800 XT, with a total of 36 GB of VRAM). Evaluate my plan, suggest changes or details, and give harsh criticism when needed. At the end, also reform my entire plan in more detail and accuracy. Also explain mathematical aspects of all models in detail. The implementation is done on PyTorch on the ROCM platform, which are factors to consider, but unlikely to affect the implementation.

What I need is a structure for the hybrid model that uses the available data the best. 

This plan is presented in both a way to instruct future prompts from programming models and as a base plan for human programmers.

# The plan

The final model should incorporate multiple ML tecniques, such as but not limited to NNs (LSTM, RNN, transformers), gradient boosted trees, and bayesian networks to form a hybrid model with propagated uncertainty throughtout the model. It should also inlude a RL part for market selection and optimal betting, and tools to inspect prediction patterns and problems. 

The probabilistic approach needs player strenght tracking, so based on the features (input variables) the model is able to extract from the database a Glicko-2 based custom rating system should be created for each measurable skill aspect of a player. These probablistic uncertainty accounting ratings should at the very least be made for:
- Player overall strenght
- Serve strenght in isolation
- Return of serve strenght in isolation
Or any other metric, where an isolated strenght rating would be beneficial. 

The training set is large, and includes every ATP match from 2011 till present. I also have pinnacle (a sharp book) closing line odds for every match as a market reference. This can be used as training data (less likely to be beneficial) or to evaluate bankroll growth.

Categorical features require conditional algorithms to be able to be incorporated to a bayesian network. It is yet completely unclear how this would be implemented.

## Feature classification

> Features are classified into categories in this project. This naming convention should be abided by all costs for clarity sake.
> - **Core features**
>   - Features strictly extracted from publicly available data sources, such as ATP, weather APIs, etc.
> - **Derived features**
>   - Features that are calculated using core features as input variables. They are simple, often one dimensional, and are used in a similar manner as core features are.
>   - They may be processed in the following ways:
>       - By simple function of one or more core features (e.g. rest interval from match dates and time)
>       - By simple conditional algorithmic process
>       - By applying statistical techniques, such as normalization or by utilizing probabilistic distributions
> - **Complex features**
>   - High dimensional features formed with ML techniques or sophisticated algorithms
>   - Most often a tensor
>   - Can be e.g. a player characteristic tensor with strenght values in various conditions and matchups (perhaps used in a transformer)

## The available features

- **Tournament name**
    - Which can also be used as a feature, since there might exist a pattern of player performance dependant on which tournament they are playing. Obviously the feature is not literally the tournament name, but the tournament itself as an enviroment
    - This could open up a possibility for tournament specific characterization, maybe utilized in a transformer together with multidimensional player charasterics vectors. 
    - The caveat is that this could accidentally include allready incorporated and weighted features, like playing surface etc. 
- **Court surface**
    - A major feature, since it is known that player strenghts differ by court surface.
    - Court surface can be combined with other features, such as weather conditions to form composite player strenght values where a players adaptibility to different weather conditions in each specific surface is taken into account.
- **Draw size**
    - How many players there are in a tourney before eliminations.
    - Unlikely to be a major predictor
- **Tourney level**
    - Characterized into the following categories:
        - Grand Slam (G)
        - Masters 1000s (M)
        - Other (A)
        - Tour finals (F)
        - Davis Cup (D)
    - Tournament presitige influences how much pressure players endure.
    - Can be used to construct complex player features.
- **Tourney date / match date**
    - Used for time tracking and for calculating rest periods.
- **Winner/loser seed**
- **Winner/loser handedness**
    - Right/left -handedness
- **Winner/loser height**
- **Winner/loser age**
- **Winner/loser nationality**
- **Match scores**
    - Used to calculate rating scores.
        - e.g. a large point differential implicates a larger skill difference
- **Sets in a match (Best of X)**
- **Tournament round**
    - SF, QF, R16, F, etc.
- **Match time lenght**
    - Possibly a contributor of fatigue.
    - Short matches indicate a more dominant victory, and vice versa.
    - Can be aggregated in player endurance measurements. E.g. a player that consistently wins lenghty matches likely demonstrates above average endurance, both mental and physical. This can be correlated to withstanding exceptional weather conditions.
- **Winne/loser aces**
    - Can be used to track and quantisize player serve strenght and/or serve receiving strenght of the opposite player.
- **Winner/loser double faults**
    - Used to track serve strenght, consistency and other complex features.
- **Winner/loser serve points played**
- **Winner/loser 1st serves made**
- **Winner/loser 1st serve points won**
- **Winner/loser 2nd serve points won**
- **Winner/loser amount of serve games**
- **Winner/loser break points saved**
    - When the returner was one point away from winning, how many serve points did the server win.
- **Winner/loser break points faced**
    - When the returner was one point away from winning the game.
- **Winner/loser ATP rank**
    - As of tourney beginning date
- **Winner/loser ATP points**

### Weather features

> Weather data can be fetched to hourly precision, but match data exists primarily by date precision, which bottlenecks the the degree of applicability of weather statistics. However e.g. outdoor grasscourts are likely affected for the whole duration of the match day whether or not it rained in the night or early morning. In contrast late evening/nightly rain is unable to affect retroactively in the same date, which has to be taken in to account. Timezones should also be considered in data validation.
- **Rain**
    - Can be quite accurately geomarked to the very stadium the match is played on.
    - Affects playing conditions
- **Rain periods (list of periods)**
- **Outdoor/indoor court**
    - A boolean
    - Implicates whether to account weather and climate as features
- **Humidity (average, peak, peak time)**
    - Can affect recovery and the degree of exhaustion due to impaired player thermoregulation (less sweat evaporation)
    - High humidity results in more sweating, which in term results in dehydration. It is possible together with endurance scoring to deduce a player's resistance to uncomfort, and thus use local humidity as a predictive measure.
- **Temperature (an hourly list)**
    - Similar remarks as humidity.
    - As vaporized water in air (which humidity measures) conducts heat, temperature and humidity should form a composite value and be utilized in deducting and tracking player endurance scores (which are vectors/tensors used in transformers)
- **Wind speed**
    - High wind speed negates the effects of high temperature and humidity.
    - Otherwise unlikely to be a predictive measure, but who knows?

# Tennis hybrid model masterplan

## Milestones

- Incorporate multiple machine learning techniques to form a single win/loss prediction model.

## Model input variables (features)

> Input variables, AKA features, should be carefully picked and rigorously questioned whether they are relevant predictors of outcome.
> By *features* we refer to the unprocessed raw data (not having gone throught any normalization, weighting or algorithmic processing).

- Court temperature, humidity, rain, wind with exact court coordinate precision on weather tracking
